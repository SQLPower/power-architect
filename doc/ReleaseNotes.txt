0.9.12

 New Features:
  * Added support for ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions in all supported
    database platforms, both forward and reverse engineering

    model documentation easier.
  
 Bug Fixes:
  * It is now possible to delete indexes from the DB Tree view

    table's primary key.


0.9.11
New Features:
  * Forward engineering scripts are now organized so that parent tables are
 created before any of their children.
  * PDF profiling reports now show the database connection name and the fully-
 qualified table name rather than just the unqualified table name
  * An easier-to-use executable (.exe) installer for Windows users
  * A new Installation Guide
  * Framework to support multiple langauges. Partial Korean translation available.

  * Ability to focus on either the parent or child table of a relationship from its 
  right-click menu
  * Ability to delete columns when columns and relationships are selected at the same time
  * Ability to align tables either horizontally or vertically on the Playpen
  * Ability to delete items by deleting their corresponding node in the DB Tree

  * Fixed a bug which prevented PK columns from getting pushed into tables
 beyond immediate children (see forum thread 1899)
  * List of source connections in the top menu bar now updates properly
  * Bug 1548: BLOB and CLOB no longer specify precision/size in Oracle DDL

  * Added work-around for Oracle JDBC driver bug: Reverse engineering Oracle databases 
  no longer performs ANALYZE TABLES operation!
 
Known Issues:
  * If you create a table with a self-referencing relationship, and you move the
  'foreign' key column around, it may start throwing Exceptions. If you plan to
  use a lot of self-referencing relationships in your data model, we recommend
  that you continue using version 0.9.10.
  
  
0.9.10
  * Release is now licensed under the GPL version 3.
  * Revamped support for creating, editing, and reverse engineering indexes.
  * Fixed the relationship lines to be straight when printing if they were
 already straight in the playpen.
  * Added preliminary support for Apache Derby.  It is now possible to connect
 to a Derby instance and use it as a source database.  Forward engineering
 is not available yet.
  * Relationship connection points can now be moved along acceptable edges on tables.
  * Playpen zoom level and view position now gets saved with the project.
  * Tables are now drawn correctly in print preview when printing the data model.
  * Fixed some table formatting issues when generating a table profile PDF report.
  * The 'Copy Table Data' tool now has a button for the Database Connection Settings.
  * Fixed a bug that caused non-identifying relationships to be reverse engineered
as identifying relationships in the Playpen.


0.9.9
  * Added support for explicitly named sequences in PostgreSQL and Oracle
  * Added the ability to choose the constraint checking deferrability policy
 on foreign key relationships on supported platforms
  * Tweaked the database comparison feature to ignore meaningless data type
 differences between columns (for example, DECIMAL vs. NUMERIC)
  * Got rid of an excessive repainting problem introduced in version 0.9.8
 (improves drawing performance)
  * Added the SQL BOOLEAN type to the set of generic types.  It forward
 engineers to BOOLEAN on platforms that support it, and TINYINT on
 platforms that lack the BOOLEAN type.
  * Added DDL (forward engineering) support for HSQLDB
  * Fixed a bug in the SQL script dialog where if the user has chosen not to
 continue after an error, clicking execute has no effect.
  * Added a GUI relationship column mapping editor, allowing you to change which
primary key column a foreign key maps to in the relationship properties editor. 
  * Fixed support for self-referencing relationships (where the primary key
and foreign key are in the same table).
  * Improved 'Zoom-to-Fit' feature so that it can zoom-to-fit on selected objects 
in the playpen instead of the entire model. Useful for very large data models.
  * The table profiler can now optionally perform its calculations locally, instead
of on the database server. This may improve profiling performance.
  * Changed the action for Enter in the play pen to edit the selected item, 
it is no longer limited to columns.


0.9.8
  * Fixed a bug where re-profiling a cancelled profile would freeze the GUI until
 the profiling was finished.
  * Fixed recent menu. It now works as expected.
  * Fixed forward engineering syntax error for LONG and LONG RAW in Oracle.
  * Added convenient shortcut for performing a structural comparison directly from
 tree view of source database connections.
  * Added the ability to forward engineer auto-increment columns in MySQL, PostgreSQL
 and SQL Server.
  * Added project option to have relationship lines drawn as direct, straight lines
 or in the old rectilinear style.  The default is still the old style.
  * Made dragging tables much easier at extreme zoom levels by dragging the table
 instead of a column when dragging with the Alt key held down (option key on Mac)
  * Added a new feature to automatically straighten relationship lines that can be
 straightened without moving any tables.  It can be found in the play pen's context
 menu (also known as the popup menu or the right-click menu).
  * Corrected the DDL syntax for adding a column in SQL Server (the COLUMN keyword
 is not allowed)


0.9.7
  * Fixed a bug with handling of automatic cascading primary keys in multi-level
 identifying relationships.
  * Fixed a bug which was causing the Architect to save corrupt project files.
 This bug was triggered by adding and removing a column from the primary key.
  * Further enhanced the profile manager so it is possible to run profiles
 multiple times per session.
  * Made it possible to add new database connection types from within the GUI.
  * Corrected the JDBC URL template for IBM DB2.  If upgrading, to obtain this fix,
 you have to remove the DB2 database type from the user preferences dialog,
 then restart the Architect.
  * Corrected an error in the user guide relating to the creation of FK
 relationships.
  * And more!


0.9.6

Initial open-source release!

  * Added the ability to create ETL jobs for Pentaho Data Integration (formerly
 Kettle)
  * A number of bug fixes
  * Replaced the icon set with the free FAMFAMFAM icon set, which looks much
 nicer than the Java Look-and-feel Graphics Repository we were using before.


0.9.5

Internal release, not publically promoted.

  * Major bugfix: We now escape all characters in the project file which are
 impossible to represent in XML.  It is entirely possible for these characters
 to sneak into a profile result.


0.9.4

  * Added PDF Export feature under File menu
  * Added MySQL compatibility
  * Improved DDL Generator Warnings interface to include a better UI and a "quick
 fix" feature which guesses the new value
  * Improved Profiling GUI to include a profile manager for browsing, searching,
 and deleting existing profile data in the project
  * Added index support for tables, forward engineering, and reverse engineering
 (supports unique and non-unique indices)
  * Completely reworked the strategy for loading JDBC driver classes.  New features
 include:
  +A better GUI for configuring database connections
  +Users can create new database connection types within the Architect (previously
   this required editing PL.INI by hand)
  +Can have multiple versions of the same driver in use at the same time (required
   for Oracle 8i/9i/10g)
  +It is now possible to ship Architect distributions with JDBC drivers built in
  +There is now a place where we will be able to allow much more user configuration
   per database type in the future
  +Unfortunately, this change is not backward compatible with the 0.0.x versions
   of the Architect PL.INI file.
  * Replaced the old tree icons with much nicer-looking new ones

IMPORTANT NOTE to users upgrading from pre-0.9.x versions of the Architect:
 We have made incompatible modifications to the PL.INI file which specifies
 your database connections.  After upgrading to this version, you will need
 to set up database connection types for all your databases in the user
 preferences dialog, then edit the properties on your existing connections
 to associate them with one of the configured database types.  This will
 also apply to connections within projects you have saved with older versions
 of the Architect.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but the benefits will
 outweigh the costs!



0.0.91
