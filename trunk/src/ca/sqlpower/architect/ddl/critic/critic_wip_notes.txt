The critics system is a work in progress. This file documents the progress of that work.
It is organized into three sections:

1. Outstanding items I know I need to implement
2. Problems and/or design questions I have not yet made a decision about
3. Reminders about pitfalls I anticipate I might run into in the future if I'm not vigilant


1. TODO:

*TableCellRenderer for SQLObjects (so we get nice icons)
*Severity for criticisms (share severity enum with validation API? move it up into the library's core?)
*Icon in table for criticism severity
*Underline criticized things in playpen
*Badge criticized things in dbtree
*nice type name routine/method that shows type name and optionally precision,scale (could be in SQLColumn or SQLObjectUtils)
 *use this in relationship mapping criticizer
 *use this in tablepane renderer as well!
*Preferences API and GUI for selecting which critics to use (and to configure the ones that need it)
*disperse classes into the appropriate places (including migrating into library)
*need a way of silencing a particular warning (for example, a table that has no PK defined
 on purpose). It would be neat if you could right click a warning and choose "Ignore..." which
 would bring up a prompt like "Ignore just this instance of the warning, or disable this type
 of warning for all objects?"

2. Things I'm not sure about:

* is it actually useful for a critic to return a list of criticisms?
  it would be nicer to write a critic if it could return 0 or 1 criticisms.
  OTOH, the relationship mapping critic wants to be able to comment on several
  different mappings in the same relationship.

* should a critic be written to criticize exactly one thing? for example,
  the first critic I wrote was for checking the physical name of a SQLObject.
  It checks both the length of the name as well as its legality (by matching
  it with a provided regex). Should this be two critics?

* should a criticizer be disposable or reusable? I think it would be much simpler
  if disposable, but then things like the table model would keep losing their state
  (due to a full structure change every time anything changes)

* can we use the JAR SPI system to enumerate the critics that currently exist in
  the classpath?
  
* how can we improve the use of generics so a critic like PrimaryKeyCritic can implement
  Critic<SQLTable> instead of the overly-general Critic<SQLObject>?
  * how about making an AbstractSQLObjectCritic<S extends SQLObject> implements Critic<SQLObject>
    and have subclasses provide the single type they're interested in (SQLObject is legal if you want
    to do your own type filtering). This would let us easily ignore things like SQLTable.Folder and
    SQLRelationship.ColumnMapping, which never need direct criticism
  
  
3. Things to keep in mind:

* it would be nice if criticisms were stored in such a way that it's easy to
  invalidate/reevaluate only the necessary objects whenever a change takes place.
  For example:
   * PrimaryKeyCritic: The primaryKeySize attribute of the SQLTable in question
   * PhysicalNameCritic: Just the physicalName property of the object with the disagreeable name
   * RelationshipMappingTypeCritic:
     * The type, precision, and scale of the parent and child columns in the mapping
     * The mapping itself (shrink or grow)
   Something else to consider here is how to handle the disappearance of existing criticized
   objects and the appearance of new objects to criticize.
