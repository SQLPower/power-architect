  <ul>
  <li>appletXMLtoHTML.html transforms XML into HTML, and displays the XML document and XSL stylesheet as well as the HTML transformation result.<br/><br/></li>
  <p>The applet looks for xalan.jar, xercesImpl.jar, xml-apis.jar and serializer.jar in the bin directory. If the JAR files are elsewhere, you must move them or adjust the applet archive setting in client.html.</p>
</ul>
<p>For information about the samples (what they illustrate and how to run them), see <a href="../../docs/samples.html">Samples</a>.</p>
