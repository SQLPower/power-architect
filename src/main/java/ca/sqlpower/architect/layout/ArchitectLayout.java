 * The ArchitectLayout interface is a generic interface to a collection of

 * <p>
 * Example for using this interface:
 * <pre>
 *   ArchitectLayout layout = new MyFavouriteLayout();
 *   layout.setup(myNodes, myEdges, myMaximumBounds);
 *   while (!layout.isDone()) {
 *     layout.nextFrame();
 *     myComponent.paint();
 *   }
 * </pre>
